# Unofficial-Rimworld-Vanilla-Expanded---Royalty-Patch-
Their Is a Problem currently At least at the time of posting relating to the VanillaFactionExpandedVikings_Patches.xml. This is A unnofficial Fix created by me.

The fix Should be dropped in The Rimworld Vanilla Expanded - Royalty Patch Folder at the path `` 294100\2260012940\1.3\Patches `` located in your steam workshop content for Rimworld 
I have Done nothing other than remove the Outdated line that calls The esquire Title that links the Viking Royalty To Fur beds. Seems to be Removed from the game so it Fails to apply 
the patch because of that .
