# Unofficial-Rimworld-Vanilla-Expanded---Royalty-Patch-
Their Is a Problem currently At least at the time of posting relating to the VanillaFactionExpandedVikings_Patches.xml. This is A unnofficial Fix created by me.

--How to Install? --
--
The fix Should be dropped in The Rimworld Vanilla Expanded - Royalty Patch Folder at the path `` 294100\2260012940\1.3\Patches `` located in your steam workshop content for Rimworld 

-- Whats changed --
--
I have Done nothing other than remove the Outdated line that calls The esquire Title that links the Viking Royalty To Fur beds. Seems to be Removed from the game so it Fails to apply. Also Removed The patch to Allow royals to eat rat cheese from genetic rim which was stopping the patch from applying.
